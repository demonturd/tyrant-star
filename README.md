# tyrant-star
A simple class designed to simulate an RNG interaction in the MMORPG Maplestory. The data used to formulate the program was taken from https://forum.nexoneu.com/showthread.php?1473734-Starforce-rates. Given an input of three integers, the star you are starting at, the star you wish to end at, and the amount of simulations you'd like to run. The program outputs the average amount of attempts you will need to reach the star, the average amount of exploded capes, and the amount of mesos it will take on average to reach the desired star.

Note: There is no sort of data-validation or typesafe elements to the program and thus entering non-integer data into the console when prompted will result in a run-time error.
